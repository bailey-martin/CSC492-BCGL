title: January Update
---

January was a busy month for RAID Inc.! We have created an idea for a product that we want to make public within the next 5 months.  

Our idea is called BCGL, which stands for Barcode Grocery List. It will scan the barcodes of products and add them to a shopping list for the users. Say, for example, a user runs out of milk. This application will allow them to scan the barcode, which will then add milk to their grocery list, which appears in the app. They can then take this list to the store, and remove items as they pick them up.  

This month, we have created a list of requirements for BCGL. We have also added those requirements into a complete Software Requirements Specification document, which can be viewed in the "Documents" page.
