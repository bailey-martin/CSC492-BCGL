title: Week 7 Recap (2-22-21 to 2-28-21)
---

Week 7 of the semester is now complete and we have made significant progress on the BCGL project. This week our primary focus was on deliverables, as we had 2 important, upcoming due dates.  

On Monday during our class period, we presented our Introductory Presentation to the class. Our presentation went well, as all team members spoke effectively and were prepared for the presentation. We did well on the length of the presentation and met the time requirements. This was an opportunity for us to formally share our project plan with the other software development teams in the class as well as with Professor Cindric. It was also interesting to listen to the other 2 groups present and to learn more about their development plans.  

On Tuesday, we held our regularly-scheduled meeting via Microsoft Teams. During this meeting, we began working as a group on Design Document 1. The rough draft of this document is due on Monday, March 1st. We focused on formatting the document and began to work on writing the various sections of the document. By the end of the meeting, we had a rough outline of the content we planned to include.  

On Wednesday afternoon, we held another meeting to continue to work on Design Document 1. We decided it would be best to work as a group on designing the DFD portion of the document. We designed it first on a whiteboard, and then worked to digitally build it into our Design Document 1. This was a large undertaking, as there was a large amount of discussion between team members throughout this task.  

For the rest of the week, RAID Inc. worked to continue to add to and revise Design Document 1 in preparation for Monday's rough draft submission. Check back next week for another update!
