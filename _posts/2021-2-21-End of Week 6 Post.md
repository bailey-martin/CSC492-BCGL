title: Week 6 Recap (2-15-21 to 2-21-21)
---

Week 6 of the semester is now complete! This week our key focuses included initial project development and preparation for the Intrductory Presentation.  

On Monday of this week, we held a group meeting to continue to work on getting our GitHub project repository initialized with a base Xamarin project. Although all group members were able to pull down a copy of our initial Xamarin successfully, we encountered issues with temporary file changes conflicting. We worked to implement a GitIgnore to handle temporary configuration files, but are still experiencing some issues. It almost feels like the GitIgnore is not working, as many files are still appearing as modified in GitHub Desktop. We spent most of our meeting time troubleshooting this issue. We met during our class time today.  

On Tuesday, RAID Inc. met virtually via Microsoft Teams. We picked up where we left off from yesterday's meeting. We felt that it was important to get the GitHub repository configured properly, as this would hopefully save us future headaches. After reformatting the GitIgnore, we still experienced issues while running our project on various computers. We decided to remove all of the files in the repository, as they may have been set up incorrectly. We then implemented a GitIgnore template designed specifically for Visual Studio projects. After the GitIgnore file was committed to the repository, we created a new Xamarin project and committed it to the repository as well. The project compiles and executes properly. After testing with various group members, the GitIgnore now seems to be working, as temporary configuration files are not showing up as "Modified" in GitHub Desktop.

RAID Inc. also held a meeting on Wednesday. At this meeting, we dedicated our time to working on the Introductory Presentation for our project. This presentation will be given in class on Monday, and is designed to give our class a better idea of our vision for the CSC 492 semester project. We reviewed the instructions provided on the course webpage, and discussed how we would partition the presentation. Each group member is responsible for preparing their slides and for presenting their assigned portion of the presentation. We will also be meeting on Sunday to review the presentation in preparation for Monday's class.
