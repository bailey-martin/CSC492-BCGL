title: Week 9 Recap (3-8-21 to 3-14-21)
---

Another productive week has passed! This week our primary focus was again on development, as we are on schedule with our deliverables.  

This past Monday, RAID Inc. did not formally meet. Instead, we attended an in-person class session that reviewed for the upcoming Midterm Exam. Professor Cindric also introduced Design Document 2, which we will be starting in the near future.

On Tuesday, we held our regularly-scheduled meeting via Microsoft Teams. During this meeting, Bailey provided a general progress update to the team. Kyle officially submitted an application to the Walmart Development team, requesting access to their public product API. This API might be a good fit for our project. Bailey shared some UI development progress with the team and gave an update on the development of the Firebase Authentication mechanism for the login page. We then worked to develop an initial BCGL logo that can be used in the app, in addition to our RAID Inc. logo.

On Wednesday afternoon, RAID Inc. met again. This was a good meeting oppportunity, as it was a Spring Relax day. The main focus of this meeting was to make progress as a team on the implementation of the SQLite databases. Andrew is heading up the implementation, but we are assisting in troubleshooting. Each member also gave a summary of their progress on their individually-assigned tasks and will continue to work on them though the weekend.

For the remainder of the week, RAID Inc. worked to continue development on specific project tasks and to individually prepare for the upcoming midterm. See you next week!
