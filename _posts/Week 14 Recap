title: Week 14 Recap (4-5-21 to 4-11-21)
---

This past Monday, RAID Inc. held a formal group meeting in person. The primary focus was on finishing up the user's manual, which the rough draft was due on Wednesday this week. They also took an inventory of what else we need to do moving forward.

On Tuesday, RAID Inc. used Microsoft Teams to work on cleaning up the code that they have for BCGL. This included removing un-used code and adding comments that explained what was going on within each section. This was in an attempt to make it easier to update and read moving forward.

On Wednesday afternoon, RAID Inc. had another in-person meeting, where they added images to the code for the display on of the app logo which would appear on the home page of the device being used. They also continued to clean up the code, as they had been the day before.

For the remainder of the week, RAID Inc. worked on revising their user's manual, as well as continuing to add comments to the existing code that they have for the BCGL application. 

Check this page again next week for more updates!
