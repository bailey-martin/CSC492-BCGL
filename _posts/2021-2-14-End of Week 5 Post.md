title: Week 5 Recap (2-8-21 to 2-14-21)
---

It's hard to believe that another week has passed, and that we have now completed the 5th week of the semester.  

On Monday, we held a group meeting to continue to work on the Preliminary Project Schedule document that is due on Wednesday of this week. We continued to brainstorm important tasks and dates that would be associated with the development of BCGL. We met during our class time today.  

On Tuesday, we opted to hold an in-person meeting instead of our regularly-scheduled digital one. We wanted to meet in the afternoon instead. We started the meeting by printing the final version of our initial press release. The image quality looked good, and we submitted it to Professor Cindric. After he grants us permission, we will display them in the Computer Science area of KHIC. We then worked on finalizing our Preliminary Project Schedule Document. Today's major focus was on the revision of our Gantt chart. We added the specific development tasks that we identified in yesterday's meeting. Additionally, I placed all of those items on our GitHub Kanban board. I included screenshots of the Kanban board in the Preliminary Project Schedule Document.  

Lastly, RAID Inc. met again on Wednesday. At this meeting, we began to discuss and work on the initial development and coding aspects of the project. We are ahead on class assignments and now have some time to dedicate to development. We each configured Visual Studio on our machines, and created a test "Hello World" app using the Xamarin framework. We also set up Android device emulators to test our apps. Individually, we will begin to read Xamarin documentation over the weekend in preparation for next week.
