title: Week 13 Recap (4-5-21 to 4-11-21)
---

Software development on the BCGL app has started to wind down, as RAID Inc. is putting the finishing touches on the app.  

This past Monday, RAID Inc. held a formal group meeting in person. The primary focus was on tying all of the parts of the app that have been created (the barcode scanner, add and edit list function, search function, etc) together so that they function as one singular application. Now the scanner adds to a list, rather than just scanning. The edit list function is working properly. Finally, the navigation bar at the bottom has been finalized so that everything is easily accessible.

On Tuesday, it was some more of the same items from Monday. RAID Inc. focused on finishing up the BCGL. Moving forward, they have some things left to button up and improve, but the bulk of the code for the app is functional.

On Wednesday afternoon, RAID Inc. had another in-person meeting, focused mainly on writing their user manual. They got it halfway done, and agreed to each take a part to work on individually moving forward in the week.

For the remainder of the week, RAID Inc. worked on their user's manual. Bailey finished the "Getting Started" section of the general instructions. Kyle did the "Specific Instructions" section. Andrew took on the "Other Issues", "Troubleshooting", "List of Commands", and "Index" portions.
