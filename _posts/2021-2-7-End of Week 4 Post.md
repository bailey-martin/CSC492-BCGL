title: Week 4 Recap (2-1-21 to 2-7-21)
---

January was a busy month for RAID Inc.! We have an idea for a software product that we want to make public within the next 5 months.  

Our software idea is called BCGL, which stands for Barcode Grocery List. This mobile app will scan the barcodes of products and add them to a user's shopping list. Say, for example, a user runs out of milk. This application will allow them to scan the barcode, which will then add milk to their grocery list. The grocery list appears in the mobile app. Users can then take this list with them to the store, and remove items from the shopping list as they pick them up.  

This month, we have created a list of requirements for BCGL. We have also incorporated those requirements into a complete Software Requirements Specification document, which can be viewed on the [Documents](https://bailey-martin.github.io/CSC492-BCGL/documents/) page.

Check back soon, as we will be posting weekly updates to document the progress on our software development project!
