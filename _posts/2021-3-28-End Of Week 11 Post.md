title: Week 11 Recap (3-22-21 to 3-28-21)
---

It is hard to believe that we have already reached the end of March! This week the RAID Inc. team focused the majority of their efforts on software development tasks.  

This past Monday, RAID Inc. held a formal group meeting. Bailey provided a demonstration of the login page authentication. The team identifed a few bugs with the behavior of the authentication mechanism, and worked to address them. At first, the app was not accepting valid credentials and displayed an error message stating they were invalid. This was quick fix with some additional try/catch statements, and allowed us to do some more in-depth testing of the login functionality.  

On Tuesday, we held our regularly-scheduled meeting via Microsoft Teams. During this meeting, RAID Inc. worked to address an issue with the navigation mapping associated with the app's login screen. Upon successful authentication, the app would open to the proper screen, but would not contain the bottom navigation bar. This was an issue, as the user was be limited to viewing one page of the app. We worked to fix this, but ended up displaying the navigation bar on all pages, including the login page. Therefore, a user could bypass the authentication by clicking a button on the navigation bar. This issue has since been resolved. Additionally, the team discussed the implementation of the SQLite database. Andrew is heading this up, and Kyle has several products that he plans to enter into the product database.

On Wednesday afternoon, RAID Inc. scheduled another meeting. The goal of this meeting was to continue work on the BCGL database. Many other features and functions of the app stem off of the database, and require it to be functional before they can be designed and implemented. Although there is still some additional work to be done, the database was created and is ready to be connected to the rest of the application.

For the remainder of the week, RAID Inc. worked individually on a varity of project tasks. Andrew continued to work on the database and Bailey worked to begin adding query methods. Kyle is gathering products and their SKU's to add to the product database. Bailey also worked to integrate camera functionality, barcode scanning recognition via a device's camera, and on the final draft of Design Document 2. Check back next week for another update on our progress!
