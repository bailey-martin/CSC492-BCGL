title: Week 8 Recap (3-1-21 to 3-7-21)
---

We have now officially reached the halfway point of the semester! This week our primary focus was on development, as we are on schedule with our deliverables.  

This past Monday, RAID Inc. focused on delegating specific development tasks to each group member. During our team meeting, we each chose a specific task to focus on. Bailey is responsible for the app's "About" page and for adding a logo to the "Login" page. Josh will be implementing the list functionality and is working to allow multiple lists to be created. Kyle is continuing to research the best API for the project, and Andrew is working on building internal SQLite databases.

On Tuesday, we held our regularly-scheduled meeting via Microsoft Teams. During this meeting, we discussed changes that we needed to make to Design Document 1, in preparation for next Monday's due date. In addition, we worked as a team to develop the app's internal data structure and researched SQLite's capabilities. We also discussed different APIs, and found that Walmart has a public one that may be useful.

On Wednesday afternoon, we held another meeting to continue to work on the development of our project. We each worked independently on our assigned tasks, but also discussed our progress and any obstacles that we were facing. Each group member will spend the rest of the week working on their assigned task. Each task should be developed on a different branch of the GitHub repository. After development is complete, team members will review the branch before merging it into the main development branch. This will ensure that we do not break any existing code and will help to improve the overall quality of our software.

For the remainder of the week, RAID Inc. worked to continue development on specific project tasks. Next week, we will provide another update, and aim to tackle a new set of development tasks!
