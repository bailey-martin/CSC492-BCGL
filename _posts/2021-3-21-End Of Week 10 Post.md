title: Week 10 Recap (3-15-21 to 3-21-21)
---

Another week of the semester has passed! This week the team focused on preparing Design Document 2, as the rough draft is due on Monday, March 22nd.  

This past Monday, RAID Inc. did not meet, as we took a Midterm during the regularly scheduled class period.  

On Tuesday, we held our regularly-scheduled meeting via Microsoft Teams. During this meeting, Bailey and Kyle worked to begin drafting Design Document 2. They worked to identify the 4 major software components and modules contained within the BCGL software. RAID Inc. chose to further discuss the barcode scanning functionality, the manual SKU search functionality, the process of shopping list creation, and how product information is stored in a list. We chose to represent the processes and data components associated with each module by using pseudocode modules. This helps the team and reader to understand the logic behind each module, and provides a general representation of what the source code will look like.

On Wednesday afternoon, RAID Inc. met again. This was a productive meeting, as we met in person to continue to work on Design Document 2. We also worked to iron out some bugs with our SQLite databases. Andrew is continuing to work on this for us. Kyle shared with the team that he is having trouble finding a free API, and does not know when we will hear back from Walmart or BestBuy. He emailed Professor Cindric for some guidance.

For the remainder of the week, RAID Inc. worked to continue development on specific assigned project tasks. Stop by next week for another update!
