title: Week 15 Recap (4-19-21 to 4-25-21)
---

RAID Inc. has been busy since the last update!

This past Monday, RAID Inc. held a formal group meeting in person. The main focus was on getting the user manual completed, and also finishing up with the code clean up.

On Tuesday, RAID Inc. used Microsoft Teams to begin preparing for their presentation, which is on this coming Tuesday! Time has flown!

On Wednesday afternoon, RAID Inc. had another in-person meeting, where they finished up the creation of their presentation. They spent the remainder of the week preparing their parts for the presentation, and deciding what they will say.

This is unfortunately the final update that will be on this page. It has been a pleasure working on this app with you!

-RAID Inc.
