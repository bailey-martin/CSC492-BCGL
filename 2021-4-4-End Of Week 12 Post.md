title: Week 11 Recap (3-29-21 to 4-4-21)
---

This week, the RAID Inc. team continued to focus the majority of their efforts on software development tasks.  

This past Monday, RAID Inc. held a formal group meeting in person. The primary focus was on the upcoming status meeting with Dr. Cindric on Wednesday, where the goal was to have a working prototype developed for presentation. As such, major progress was made getting the app to work in many areas, which are too many to name. Kyle was able to add products to an Excel spreadsheet, which will be added to the database via code written by Andrew. The team also got functionality on the camera, thanks in large part to Bailey's efforts. They worked on creating and adding to lists. They also buttoned up all of the functions that they had been working on the previous week.

On Tuesday, we held our regularly-scheduled meeting via Microsoft Teams. During this meeting, RAID Inc. worked to address the issue of deleting and editing an item that has been added to a list, and also deleting and editing the actual list itself (i.e. changing the title and description of the list). With the new functionality, the user can swipe left if they wish to edit an item, and right if they wish to delete it. Also, when they have swiped, a pop-up window appears that confirms that the user intended to perform that function, which ensures there are no accidental deletions or edits. Also, on the confirmation, the function restores the appearance of the application, which allows the function to be displayed on screen.

On Wednesday afternoon, RAID Inc. had their status meeting with Dr. Cindric, and held an in person team meeting immediately after. The goal of this meeting was to fix any bugs that came up the last few days. The biggest bug was that the user was unable to log in on the Android app, despite entering valid credentials. This has been fixed. The team also got the rest of their editing issues figured out.

For the remainder of the week, RAID Inc. worked individually on a varity of project tasks. Andrew continued to work on the user interface, as well as getting the camera function to add to the list, rather than just scanning. Bailey also worked on user interface items, including updating the navigation bar. Kyle updated the list of products and their SKU's for the product database, and also took over the job of configuration management specialist, so he is working on the second press release. Check back next week for another update on our progress!
